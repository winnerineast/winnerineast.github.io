Embedding Atlas is a tool that provides interactive visualizations for large embeddings. It allows you to visualize, cross-filter, and search embeddings and metadata.

Features

🏷️ Automatic data clustering & labeling: Interactively visualize and navigate overall data structure.

🫧 Kernel density estimation & density contours: Easily explore and distinguish between dense regions of data and outliers.

🧊 Order-independent transparency: Ensure clear, accurate rendering of overlapping points.

🔍 Real-time search & nearest neighbors: Find similar data to a given query or existing data point.

🚀 WebGPU implementation (with WebGL 2 fallback): Fast, smooth performance (up to few million points) with modern rendering stack.

📊 Multi-coordinated views for metadata exploration: Interactively link and filter data across metadata columns.
